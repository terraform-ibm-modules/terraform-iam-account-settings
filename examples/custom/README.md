# Account Custom Settings example

An example of custom settings being applied to the account. This use case may be helpful in development environments. This example consumes the experimental submodule that uses the RestAPI provider to call an experimental API that is currently unsupported to set the `FS Validated` and `User List Visibility Restrictions` values in the example.
